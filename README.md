# A Taste of React

This repo will contains mini projects that I have attempted to get my hands better around the React framework for front-end making.

I will be clearly documenting my learning throughout this process through each project folder.

## Pokedex
Pokedex is an adaptation from the Pokemon series where the details of every pokemon can be found through a device,  called the Pokedex. Pokemon details are fetched from an array of Pokemon objects. The pcitures are fetched through the publicly available pokemon API.

### Things Learned :books:
* Introduced to JSX
* Props in React
* Used integrated toolchain, create-react-app

## Dice Game
This is a die rolling simulator. It will pick numbers at random and render the respective icon based on tha latter. The icons are fetched fron Font Awesome and styled using styled components.

* Difference between state and props

## Hangman
Hangman is a game where you have to figure out the chosen word under 6 moves, that is before the full stick figure has been drawn. If you do, you win, else you lose.
